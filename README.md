Derailer is a tool that helps test for how services handle random dependency failures, on [Railway](https://railway.com). Inspired by [Netflix's Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey).

Derailer randomly removes instances of running services, or remove the service entirely. Allowing you to build more resilient services by finding missed opportunities to handle failures gracefully.
